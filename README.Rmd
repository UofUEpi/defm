The goal of defm is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of defm like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(defm)
## basic example code

# Simulating core data
n   <- 500
n_y <- 4
n_x <- 4

set.seed(1231)
Y <- matrix(as.integer(runif(n * n_y) < .05), ncol = n_y)
X <- matrix(rnorm(n * n_x), ncol = n_x)
id <- sort(rep(1:100, 5))

# Creating the model and adding a couple of terms
d_model <- new_defm(id, Y, X, order = 1)

term_defm_ones(d_model)
term_defm_fe(d_model, 0)
term_defm_transition(d_model, c(0,4,5))

init_defm(d_model)

simulated_Y <- sim_defm(d_model, c(-.5, .5, 1))
simulated_Y <- matrix(as.vector(simulated_Y), byrow = TRUE, ncol = n_y)

# Filling the gaps
locations <- which(simulated_Y == -1)
simulated_Y[locations] <- Y[locations]

View(cbind(id, simulated_Y))

print(d_model)

f <- function(p, as_log=TRUE) loglike_defm(d_model, p, as_log = as_log)
ans <- optim(c(0,0,0), f, control = list(fnscale = -1), hessian = TRUE, method = "L-BFGS-B", lower = -10, upper = 10)

f(ans$par,FALSE)

```
